          <p>A glimpse into my journey</p>
          <p>
            I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student passionate about exploring
            different areas in technology. I enjoy learning new skills and
            building things that helps me to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm exploring web development, databases, and cloud
            computing. As a student, my journey is still unfolding, but I'm
            eager to collaborate, learn from real-world experiences, and
            contribute to helpful projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll often find me reading or simply
            bed-rotting — recharging before diving back into tech.
